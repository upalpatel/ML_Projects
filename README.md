# Machine Learning Projects

These projects were created using Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 for academic purposes.

----------

### Getting Started

Simply open each notebook ```.ipynb``` file to view the contents.

#### Project 1:

This notebook contains:

* Linear Regression
* 3rd Order Polynomial
* 5th Order Polynomial
* Average Squared Loss (MSE)
* L2 Regularization
* Plots for each

#### Project 2:

This notebook contains classifiers and decision boundaries for:

* Logistic Regression
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbor

#### Project 3:

This notebook contains Support Vector Machine classifiers and decision boundaries for:

* ```linear``` | ```poly``` | ```rbf``` | ```sigmoid``` kernels
* Confusion Matrix for ```poly``` kernel with degree 3 and degree 5
* Grid Search with Cross-Validation for the ```poly``` kernel
